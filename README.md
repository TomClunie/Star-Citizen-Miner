# Star-Citizen-Miner
Simple bot to calculate price of mined ore.

This is not a finished bot so I have not even added any error handling however I will be updating this repo so keep checking for updated versions.

Youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to get your own discord bot running.
You will also have to install the dependencies that are imported at the top of the scm.py file using pip install in your cmd.
